# QC-14-FEATURE: Feature-to-Documentation Synchronization Standards

## Purpose & Scope

Mandatory synchronization between feature specifications, roadmap tracking, and project documentation to ensure no work is orphaned and all requirements have clear implementation paths with traceability.

**Rule Status**: âœ… **ACTIVE**
**Compliance**: MANDATORY for all feature development and documentation
**Purpose**: Prevent orphaned specifications and ensure systematic feature delivery

## Core Principles

### 1. Every Feature Must Have Complete Tracking
- **Specification document** with detailed requirements
- **Roadmap entry** with priority, timeline, and status
- **Implementation tracking** with acceptance criteria
- **Cross-references** between all related documents

### 2. No Orphaned Documentation
- **Every design document** must be linked to roadmap
- **Every requirement** must have implementation plan
- **Every specification** must include status tracking
- **Every new feature** must update master documentation index

### 3. Systematic Implementation Path
- **Clear next steps** for every feature
- **Implementation instructions** for development teams
- **Acceptance criteria** for feature completion
- **Update requirements** for related documentation

## Mandatory Synchronization Requirements

### When Creating Any Feature Specification

#### 1. REQUIRED: Add to Roadmap
```yaml
roadmap_integration:
  location: "docs/requirements/feature_roadmap.md"
  required_fields:
    - status: "[DESIGN|READY|IN_PROGRESS|COMPLETE]"
    - priority: "[P0|P1|P2|P3] with justification"
    - timeline: "Realistic implementation estimate"
    - tracking: "Link to specification document"
    - dependencies: "Prerequisites and blockers"
  
  status_definitions:
    DESIGN: "Specification being written"
    READY: "Specification complete, ready for implementation"
    IN_PROGRESS: "Currently being implemented"
    COMPLETE: "Implemented and validated"
```

#### 2. REQUIRED: Update Master Index
```yaml
master_index_update:
  location: "docs/PM_TOOL_MASTER_INDEX.md"
  required_sections:
    - documentation_structure: "Add specification to appropriate category"
    - next_priorities: "Update priority list with new feature"
    - project_status: "Update current capabilities and gaps"
    - success_criteria: "Add feature to completion criteria"
```

#### 3. REQUIRED: Implementation Instructions
```yaml
implementation_tracking:
  cursor_instructions:
    - "Clear copy-paste prompt for Cursor IDE"
    - "Step-by-step implementation guide"
    - "Compliance with cursor rules (.cursor/rules/)"
    - "Test cases and validation criteria"
  
  acceptance_criteria:
    - "Specific, testable completion requirements"
    - "Definition of done for feature"
    - "Integration requirements"
    - "Documentation update requirements"
```

### When Implementing Any Feature

#### 1. REQUIRED: Status Updates
```yaml
status_tracking:
  roadmap_updates:
    - "Change status from READY to IN_PROGRESS when starting"
    - "Update timeline if estimates change"
    - "Document blockers and dependencies encountered"
    - "Change status to COMPLETE when acceptance criteria met"
  
  master_index_updates:
    - "Update current capabilities section"
    - "Remove from next priorities when complete"
    - "Update production readiness status"
    - "Add to completed features list"
```

#### 2. REQUIRED: Related Document Updates
```yaml
documentation_cascade:
  mandatory_updates:
    - "CLAUDE.md": "Add feature context for future AI agents"
    - "USER_GUIDE.md": "Document user-facing features"
    - "API_REFERENCE.md": "Document new commands/options"
    - "Architecture docs": "Update system design if changed"
  
  conditional_updates:
    - "AGENT_WORK_PROTOCOL.md": "If affects AI agent workflows"
    - "Cross-project integration": "If affects multi-project capabilities"
    - "Security documentation": "If has security implications"
    - "Testing documentation": "If requires new testing approaches"
```

### Cross-Reference Requirements

#### 1. Bidirectional Linking
```yaml
cross_reference_standards:
  specification_to_roadmap:
    - "Every spec must reference roadmap item"
    - "Roadmap item must link back to specification"
    - "Status synchronization between documents"
    - "Clear implementation path documented"
  
  roadmap_to_tracking:
    - "Implementation tracking document links"
    - "Progress tracking mechanisms"
    - "Dependency mapping"
    - "Completion validation methods"
```

#### 2. Version Control Integration
```yaml
git_integration:
  commit_requirements:
    - "Feature commits must reference roadmap item"
    - "Documentation updates in same commit as feature"
    - "Status updates committed with implementation"
    - "Cross-references maintained in commit messages"
  
  branch_naming:
    - "feature/roadmap-item-name" pattern
    - "docs/feature-name-docs" for documentation updates
    - "Links to roadmap item in branch description"
```

## Implementation Workflow

### Phase 1: Feature Design
1. **Create specification document** with complete requirements
2. **Add to feature roadmap** with status DESIGN
3. **Update master index** with new documentation reference
4. **Create implementation tracking** (Cursor prompt, acceptance criteria)
5. **Cross-reference all documents** bidirectionally

### Phase 2: Feature Implementation
1. **Update roadmap status** to IN_PROGRESS
2. **Follow implementation tracking** instructions
3. **Update related documentation** as feature progresses
4. **Maintain cross-references** during development

### Phase 3: Feature Completion
1. **Validate acceptance criteria** completion
2. **Update all related documentation** (USER_GUIDE, CLAUDE.md, etc.)
3. **Update roadmap status** to COMPLETE
4. **Update master index** current capabilities
5. **Create completion validation** checklist

## Validation Requirements

### Pre-Implementation Checklist
- [ ] Feature specification exists and is complete
- [ ] Roadmap entry exists with all required fields
- [ ] Master index updated with new feature
- [ ] Implementation instructions (Cursor prompt) created
- [ ] Acceptance criteria defined and testable
- [ ] Cross-references established between all documents

### Post-Implementation Checklist
- [ ] All acceptance criteria validated and complete
- [ ] Roadmap status updated to COMPLETE
- [ ] Master index reflects new capabilities
- [ ] All related documentation updated (USER_GUIDE, CLAUDE.md, etc.)
- [ ] Cross-references still accurate and functional
- [ ] Implementation matches specification requirements

### Audit Requirements
- [ ] No orphaned specification documents
- [ ] All roadmap items have implementation paths
- [ ] All features have complete documentation
- [ ] Cross-references are bidirectional and current
- [ ] Status tracking is accurate across all documents

## Common Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### Documentation Anti-Patterns
```yaml
prohibited_patterns:
  orphaned_specs:
    - "Creating specifications without roadmap entries"
    - "Designing features without implementation plans"
    - "Writing requirements without acceptance criteria"
    - "Creating docs without cross-references"
  
  incomplete_tracking:
    - "Starting implementation without updating status"
    - "Completing features without documentation updates"
    - "Changing requirements without updating related docs"
    - "Breaking cross-references during updates"
  
  inconsistent_status:
    - "Roadmap status doesn't match actual progress"
    - "Master index doesn't reflect current capabilities"
    - "Feature marked complete but documentation not updated"
    - "Implementation differs from specification"
```

### Process Anti-Patterns
```yaml
process_violations:
  skip_validation:
    - "Implementing without following cursor rules"
    - "Completing without acceptance criteria validation"
    - "Merging without documentation updates"
    - "Releasing without cross-reference verification"
  
  poor_communication:
    - "Status changes without stakeholder notification"
    - "Breaking changes without impact documentation"
    - "Dependencies changed without affected party updates"
    - "Priorities changed without roadmap updates"
```

## Success Metrics

### Completeness Metrics
- **100% roadmap coverage**: Every specification has roadmap entry
- **100% implementation paths**: Every roadmap item has clear next steps
- **100% cross-references**: All related documents linked bidirectionally
- **100% status accuracy**: Current status matches reality

### Quality Metrics
- **Documentation freshness**: All docs updated within 1 sprint of changes
- **Implementation accuracy**: Features match specifications
- **User experience**: Documentation enables successful feature usage
- **Maintainability**: Clear ownership and update processes

### Process Metrics
- **Feature velocity**: Time from specification to completion
- **Rework rate**: Features requiring specification changes during implementation
- **Documentation debt**: Lag between feature completion and documentation updates
- **Cross-reference accuracy**: Percentage of working vs broken links

## Enforcement Mechanisms

### Automated Checks (Future)
- **Pre-commit hooks**: Verify cross-references before commits
- **CI/CD validation**: Check documentation completeness
- **Link checking**: Validate all cross-references periodically
- **Status synchronization**: Automated status consistency checks

### Manual Reviews (Current)
- **Specification reviews**: Verify roadmap integration before approval
- **Implementation reviews**: Confirm documentation updates included
- **Release reviews**: Validate all features have complete documentation
- **Quarterly audits**: Review cross-reference accuracy and completeness
