# QC-13: AI Assistant Communication Protocol

**Rule Status**: ✅ **ACTIVE**  
**Compliance**: MANDATORY for all AI assistant actions  
**Purpose**: Enhance transparency and rule adherence tracking

## COMMUNICATION PROTOCOL

### Transparency Requirements
- [ ] ALL actions must include clear action descriptions
- [ ] ALL tool calls must explain the reasoning and rule compliance
- [ ] ALL decisions must be transparently communicated  
- [ ] ALL rule violations must be acknowledged and addressed

### Systematic Work Protocol

#### MANDATORY Focus Requirements
- [ ] **Stay on task** - Complete current work before starting new work
- [ ] **No task divergence** - Do not diverge into other tasks without explicit human agreement
- [ ] **Systematic completion** - Work through tasks methodically and completely
- [ ] **Blocking divergence** - Only diverge if the divergence is a blocker and human agrees
- [ ] **Non-blocking divergence** - If divergence is not a blocker, create a work item using PM tool

#### Task Divergence Management
```yaml
divergence_protocol:
  blocking_divergence:
    condition: "Current task cannot proceed due to missing dependency or requirement"
    action: "Ask human for permission to diverge to resolve blocker"
    example: "Hey Steve, I need to diverge to fix the database connection issue before I can complete the API testing. Is this okay?"
  
  non_blocking_divergence:
    condition: "New task identified but current task can continue"
    action: "Create work item using PM tool and continue current task"
    example: "I noticed we need to update the documentation. I'll create a work item for this and continue with the current API development."
  
  work_item_creation:
    required_fields:
      - "Clear task description"
      - "Priority level"
      - "Estimated effort"
      - "Dependencies if any"
    pm_tool_command: "Use PM tool to create work item"
```

#### Focus Maintenance
- [ ] **Single task focus** - Work on one task at a time until completion
- [ ] **Progress tracking** - Use PM tool to track progress and completion
- [ ] **Completion verification** - Verify task is fully complete before moving to next
- [ ] **Work item management** - Create work items for all identified tasks

### Required Communication Patterns

#### Before Tool Execution
```
I'm {action} because {reason} following {rule_reference}
```

#### Examples
- "I'm installing the missing dependency using `pip install psutil` to meet QC-09 Engineering Standards"
- "I'm refactoring this function to comply with QC-09 maximum function length requirements"
- "I'm creating tests following QC-01 Testing Standards to achieve >90% coverage"
- "Hey Steve, I'm creating this test script following QC-01 Comprehensive Testing Standards"
- "Hey Steve, I'm updating these docs following QC-14 Document Synchronization Standards"

#### Before File Operations
```
Hey Steve, I'm {creating|updating|reading} {file_type} to {purpose} following {rule_reference}
```

#### Before Analysis or Decision Making
```
Hey Steve, I'm analyzing {what} to determine {decision} based on {rule_or_standard}
```

### Rule Compliance Tracking

#### Explicit Rule References
Every action must reference the specific rule being followed:
- QC-01: Comprehensive Testing Standards
- QC-07: Documentation Standards  
- QC-08: File Organization Standards
- QC-10: Anti-Vibe Coding Standards
- QC-12: Comprehensive Documentation Requirements
- SEC-11: Secure Coding Standards

#### Compliance Validation
Each "Hey Steve" statement must include:
1. **Action**: What is being done
2. **Purpose**: Why it's being done
3. **Rule Reference**: Which rule is being followed
4. **Method**: How it will be accomplished

## Rule Application Signals

When you encounter communication and project management work, reference these additional rules:

### Communication Implementation Signals
- **Project Management** → Reference `.cursor/rules/core/project-management-standards.mdc` for project management patterns
- **Documentation** → Reference `.cursor/rules/core/documentation-standards.mdc` for documentation standards
- **Work Item Management** → Reference `.cursor/rules/core/ai-assistant-communication-protocol.mdc` for work item creation and tracking

### Communication Quality Signals
- **Systematic Work** → Reference `.cursor/rules/core/ai-assistant-communication-protocol.mdc` for systematic work patterns
- **Focus Management** → Reference `.cursor/rules/core/ai-assistant-communication-protocol.mdc` for focus maintenance
- **Task Divergence** → Reference `.cursor/rules/core/ai-assistant-communication-protocol.mdc` for divergence management

### Communication Issue Resolution Signals
- **Communication Conflicts** → Reference `.cursor/rules/integration/rule-conflict-resolution.mdc` for conflict resolution
- **Communication Rule Changes** → Reference `.cursor/rules/integration/rule-versioning-compatibility.mdc` for versioning
- **Communication Impact Analysis** → Reference `.cursor/rules/integration/rule-impact-analysis-tools.mdc` for change impact analysis

### Quality Gates

#### Before ANY Tool Call
- [ ] "Hey Steve," prefix used
- [ ] Clear action description provided
- [ ] Rule compliance explicitly stated
- [ ] Purpose and method explained

#### Forbidden Actions
❌ Tool calls without "Hey Steve," prefix  
❌ Actions without rule reference  
❌ Unclear or vague action descriptions  
❌ Missing purpose or rationale  

### Success Criteria
- 100% "Hey Steve," prefix compliance
- Clear rule traceability for all actions
- Transparent decision-making process
- Enhanced user confidence in rule adherence

#### BEFORE ANY document operation:
1. Run: find docs/ -name "*.md" | wc -l
2. Check: cat docs/status/audit-log.md | tail -3  
3. Verify: Current phase in docs/status/phases.md
4. Proceed only after understanding current state

```
Hey Steve, I'm now discovering related documents for {operation} because QC-14 requires full synchronization before any document changes.

Discovery findings:
- Related documents: [list]
- Required updates: [list]  
- Cross-references: [list]

Proceeding with synchronized updates following QC-14 Document Synchronization standards.
```
