# QC-17: Human-Like Writing Standards

## Purpose & Scope

This rule ensures that all written content maintains human-like quality and authenticity, avoiding patterns that make content sound AI-generated. It promotes natural, engaging, and authentic communication.

## MANDATORY Human-Like Writing Protocol

- **Natural variation** - Vary sentence structure and length naturally
- **Emotional connection** - Include appropriate emotional context when relevant
- **Individual style** - Develop a consistent but natural writing style

#### Avoid Generic Patterns
- **No formulaic structures** - Avoid predictable, uniform transitions
- **No overused phrases** - Eliminate AI-specific clichés like "delve," "synergy," "tapestry"
- **No perfect symmetry** - Avoid unnaturally balanced argument structures
- **No surface-level breadth** - Focus on depth rather than covering all angles superficially

### 2. Content Quality Standards

#### Depth Over Breadth

- **No excessive hedging** - Take appropriate stances without over-hedging

### 4. Technical Writing Standards

#### Code and Technical Content
