# GLOBAL-01: Comprehensive Rule Reading Protocol

## Purpose & Scope

This rule ensures that I systematically read, apply, and continuously audit ALL rules in `.cursor/rules/*` without missing any, preventing the incomplete analysis errors that occurred previously. This is a meta-rule that governs how I process, apply, and maintain all other rules to prevent them from going stale.

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Anonymized Repository Notice

**THIS REPOSITORY CONTAINS ANONYMIZED PLACEHOLDER VALUES FOR PUBLIC SHARING:**

All examples use placeholder values like `YOUR_USERNAME`, `YOUR_USER_ID`, `YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME`, `YOUR_PROJECT_NAME`, and `example-platform`.

**MANDATORY PLACEHOLDER REPLACEMENT PROTOCOL:**
1. **NEVER execute commands** with placeholder values
2. **ALWAYS prompt users** for real values when implementing rules
3. **VALIDATE** all placeholders are replaced before execution
4. **ASK for clarification** when encountering placeholder values
5. **TREAT placeholders as invalid** until replaced with real values

This ensures security and prevents accidental use of anonymized examples.

## MANDATORY Rule Reading Protocol

### 1. Complete Directory Traversal
When asked to follow rules in `.cursor/rules/*`, I MUST:

1. **List ALL subdirectories** in `.cursor/rules/`
2. **Read ALL `.mdc` files** in each subdirectory completely
3. **Extract ALL `alwaysApply` fields** from every file
4. **Extract ALL `globs` patterns** from every file
5. **Extract ALL `ruleId` and `title` fields** for identification
6. **Create a comprehensive mapping** of all rules by category

### 2. Systematic Rule Processing

#### Phase 1: Discovery
```bash
# I must systematically discover all rule files
find .cursor/rules/ -name "*.mdc" -type f
```

#### Phase 2: Complete Reading
For each discovered file, I must:
- Read the ENTIRE file content
- Extract the YAML frontmatter completely
- Identify the `alwaysApply` field (true/false)
- Identify the `globs` patterns
- Identify the `ruleId` and `title`
- Note any scope limitations or context requirements

#### Phase 3: Categorization
I must categorize rules into:
- **Always Apply**: `alwaysApply: true` (applied to all interactions)
- **Auto Attached**: `alwaysApply: false` but matching current file patterns
- **Agent Requested**: Rules I explicitly reference when appropriate
- **Manual**: Rules requiring explicit user instruction

### 3. Verification Protocol

Before providing any rule analysis, I must:

1. **Count total rules** discovered
2. **Count alwaysApply: true rules** 
3. **Count alwaysApply: false rules**
4. **Verify I read ALL files** in the directory structure
5. **Cross-reference** my analysis against the complete file list

### 4. Error Prevention Measures

#### Mandatory Checks
- [ ] Did I read ALL `.mdc` files in ALL subdirectories?
- [ ] Did I extract the `alwaysApply` field from EVERY file?
- [ ] Did I count the total number of rules correctly?
- [ ] Did I identify ALL rules marked as `alwaysApply: true`?
- [ ] Did I miss any files due to incomplete directory traversal?

#### Quality Assurance
- [ ] Can I provide a complete list of all rule files?
- [ ] Can I provide an accurate count of `alwaysApply: true` rules?
- [ ] Can I explain why each rule is categorized as it is?
- [ ] Have I avoided making assumptions about rule content?

## Implementation Requirements

### When Processing Rules
1. **NEVER assume** I have found all rules after reading a few files
2. **ALWAYS complete** the full directory traversal
3. **ALWAYS verify** my count against the actual file count
4. **ALWAYS double-check** the `alwaysApply` field extraction
5. **ALWAYS provide** a complete and accurate analysis

### When Reporting Rule Analysis
I must provide:
1. **Complete file count** from `.cursor/rules/*`
2. **Accurate count** of `alwaysApply: true` rules
3. **Complete list** of all rules with their categories
4. **Verification** that no rules were missed

## Error Recovery Protocol

If I discover I missed rules in my analysis:
1. **Immediately acknowledge** the error
2. **Re-read ALL rule files** completely
3. **Provide corrected analysis** with accurate counts
4. **Explain what went wrong** in my initial analysis
5. **Implement additional checks** to prevent recurrence

## Continuous Rule Auditing and Maintenance

### 1. Rule Health Monitoring
