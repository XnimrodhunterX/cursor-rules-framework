# INT-CONFLICT-01: Rule Conflict Resolution Standards

## Purpose & Scope

This rule provides comprehensive conflict resolution mechanisms for handling situations where multiple rules have conflicting requirements or recommendations. It establishes clear decision frameworks and escalation procedures.

## Conflict Types and Classification
