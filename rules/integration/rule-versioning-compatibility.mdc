# INT-VERSION-01: Rule Versioning and Compatibility Standards

## Purpose & Scope

This rule establishes comprehensive versioning and compatibility management for the rule system, ensuring smooth evolution, backward compatibility, and migration support as rules are updated and improved over time.

## Rule Versioning Framework

### 1. Version Numbering Scheme
```yaml
versioning_scheme:
  semantic_versioning:
    format: "MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH"
    major: "Breaking changes that require migration"
    minor: "New features that are backward compatible"
    patch: "Bug fixes and minor improvements"
  
  rule_version_format:
    format: "RULE-ID-vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH"
    examples:
      - "API-01-v2.1.3"
      - "SEC-01-v1.0.0"
      - "INT-SEC-01-v1.2.1"
  
  compatibility_matrix:
    major_version: "Incompatible with previous major versions"
    minor_version: "Compatible with same major version"
    patch_version: "Fully backward compatible"
```

### 2. Rule Metadata Versioning
```yaml
