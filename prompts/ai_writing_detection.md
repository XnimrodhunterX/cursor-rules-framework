# AI Text Detection Master List

## Voice, Perspective, and Human Touch
1. Lack of a Unique Voice and Perspective
- **Generic and Formulaic** – Text is technically correct but lacks personality or distinct style.
- **Absence of Personal Experience** – No genuine anecdotes, emotions, or life events.
- **Formulaic Structure** – Predictable, uniform transitions (“Furthermore…“, “In conclusion…“) with little stylistic variety.
2. Content Breadth vs. Depth Patterns
- **Surface-Level Breadth** – Many subtopics lightly touched rather than deep dives.
- **Even Distribution of Attention** – Similar word count across points rather than emphasis on some over others.
- **Unnatural Completeness** – Covers all “expected” angles too neatly, like ticking boxes.
3. Discourse Flow Anomalies
- **Lack of True Digression** – No side comments, tangents, or off-topic reflections.
- **Overly Formal in Casual Contexts** – Style mismatched to setting.
- **Perfect Symmetry in Argument Structure** – Balanced sections with unnatural precision.
## Language Patterns and Style
4. Repetitive Language and Overused Phrases
- **Repetitive Phrasing** – Same idea restated in slightly different ways.
- **AI-Specific Clichés** – Words like “delve,” “synergy,” “tapestry” appear disproportionately.
5. Stylistic Uniformity
- **Consistent Tone and Register** – Same level of formality throughout.
- **Uniform Sentence and Paragraph Lengths** – Regularity that’s rare in human writing.
- **Predictable Transition Markers** – Similar connectors at similar positions in paragraphs.
6. Semantic and Logical Indicators
- **Overly Neutral or Hedged Language** – Balanced but bland phrasing without stance.
- **Circular Reasoning or Redundant Logic** – Loops without new insights.
- **Overgeneralization** – Sweeping statements without nuance.
- **Logical Jumps Without Evidence** – Missing connective reasoning between claims.
7. Multilingual or Cultural Signals
- **Flat Cultural References** – Generic rather than specific/niche examples.
- **Odd Idiom Usage** – Idioms slightly out of place or in incorrect contexts.
## Formatting and Structural Habits
8. Formatting and Enumeration Patterns
- **Unnatural Punctuation Usage** – Frequent hyphens, semicolons, colons, or em-dashes where simpler punctuation is expected.
- **Over-Summarized Sentences** – Multiple ideas packed into a neat summary rather than expanded.
- **Enumeration Bias** – Overuse of “rule of three” in lists and examples.
- **Artificial Parallelism** – Sections/bullets follow identical structures regardless of content needs.
## Factual Accuracy and Content Reliability
9. Inconsistencies and Errors
- **Factual Inaccuracies / Hallucinations** – Confidently stated but false information or non-existent citations.
- **Lack of Depth or Superficial Analysis** – Summary without meaningful elaboration.
- **Strange Language or Sentence Construction** – Grammatically correct but unnatural phrasing.
10. Domain-Specific Weaknesses
- **Misuse of Technical Terms** – Correct syntax but wrong semantic application.
- **Invented References** – Fake citations, URLs, or sources.
- **Time-Insensitive Statements** – “Recent” events without specifics.
11. Content-Specific Indicators
- **Excessively Balanced Arguments** – Equal attention to both sides without natural emphasis.
- **Comprehensive Coverage Without Tangents** – Feels unnaturally complete.
- **Claims Without Verification** – Plausible-sounding but unverifiable statements.
## Statistical and Computational Patterns
12. Technical Linguistic Measurements
- **Perplexity Analysis** – Lower perplexity scores indicate more predictability.
- **Burstiness Patterns** – Consistent sentence lengths; humans vary naturally.
- **Statistical Variations** – Lower Fano Factor and cross-entropy scores.
13. Advanced Technical Patterns
- **Embedding Analysis** – Semantic vector patterns too consistent.
- **N-gram Frequency Analysis** – Statistical regularity in word sequences uncommon in human writing.
## AI-Specific Signatures and Detection Methods
14. AI-Specific Watermarking and Signatures
- **Digital Watermarks** – Invisible or statistical signals embedded during generation.
- **Steganographic Patterns** – Hidden information in word choice/order.
15. Advanced Detection Methods
- **Multi-Modal Analysis** – Keystroke dynamics, editing timelines.
- **Cross-Model Detection** – Detecting across multiple LLM architectures.
- **AI-Paraphrase Detection** – Identifying content rewritten by another AI to evade detection.
## Contextual and Process-Based Clues
16. Other Contextual Clues
- **Sudden Change in Quality** – Inconsistent with writer’s historical performance.
- **No “Messiness”** – Lack of small, intentional rule-breaking or quirks.
- **Metadata Review** – Large chunks pasted in at once in collaborative tools.
17. Revision History & Process Data
- **Single-Block Composition** – Entire sections inserted in one paste.
- **Uniform Keystroke Timing** – No natural pauses.
- **Lack of Deletions or Rewrites** – Minimal iterative editing.
18. Emerging Model Behavior Clues
- **Refusal or Evasion Patterns** – Disclaimers instead of engagement.
- **Too-Polished Code Switching** – Bilingual text is perfect but culturally sterile.
- **Template Matching** – Content mirrors common prompt-response patterns.
## Limitations and Evasion Awareness
19. Emerging Detection Challenges
- **Detection Evasion Awareness** – Models adjusted to avoid detectable patterns.
- **Bias Considerations** – Risk of misclassifying non-native or diverse writing styles.
20. Technical Accuracy Limitations
- **Probabilistic Nature** – No detection method is 100% certain.
- **Arms Race Dynamics** – Detection tech must evolve alongside AI capabilities.
## Reasoning and Context Awareness
21. Assumptive Reasoning Without Clarification
- **Overconfident Guessing** -Makes definitive statements without confirming missing details.
- **Context Drift** -Response veers off-topic due to assuming intent instead of verifying it.
- **No Clarifying Questions** -Fails to pause and ask for needed information before continuing.
