# AI Agent Workflow System - Complete Version

## ðŸš€ NEW WORKFLOW: Context-Aware Rule Application

- **90% reduction** in rule reading time (4-8 rules instead of 45+)
- **Context-aware** rule application based on task type
- **Mandatory pre-work checklists** to prevent violations
- **Clear decision trees** for different task types
- **Single entry point** for easy maintenance and updates

## âœ… QUALITY GATES (MANDATORY)

Before completing any task, verify:
- [ ] All required rules read and understood
- [ ] PM tool work items checked/created appropriately
- [ ] Git workflow followed (if applicable)
- [ ] Security standards applied (if applicable)
- [ ] Testing requirements met (if applicable)

## ðŸš¨ EMERGENCY OVERRIDE

If rule conflicts occur:
1. Stop and ask for clarification
2. Reference: INT-CONFLICT-01 (Rule Conflict Resolution)
3. Document the conflict and proposed resolution

## ðŸ“‹ CROSS-CUTTING CONCERNS

If your task involves multiple domains, read:
- INT-DECISION-01: Rule Application Decision Tree
- INT-CONFLICT-01: Rule Conflict Resolution Standards

## ðŸŽ¯ RULE DEPENDENCY MATRIX

For complex tasks, reference: `.cursor/rules/RULE_DEPENDENCY_MATRIX.md`

## ðŸ“Š SUCCESS METRICS

- **100% workflow compliance** with context-specific rules
- **0% PM tool violations** through mandatory pre-work checklists
- **90%+ task efficiency** with focused rule application
- **Complete quality gate verification** before task completion

## ðŸš€ EFFICIENCY BENEFITS

- **90% reduction** in rule reading time (4-8 rules instead of 45+)
- **Context-aware** rule application based on task type
- **Mandatory pre-work checklists** to prevent violations
- **Clear decision trees** for different task types
- **Single entry point** for easy maintenance and updates

**FAILURE TO FOLLOW = Incomplete work, rule violations, poor quality**
**SUCCESS = Context-aware compliance, efficient execution, zero violations**
