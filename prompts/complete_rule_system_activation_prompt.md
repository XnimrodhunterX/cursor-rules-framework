**CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:**
1. **ALWAYS read ALL rules** in .cursor/rules/* completely before starting any work
2. **ALWAYS apply security standards** (SEC-01, INT-SEC-01) to ALL work
3. **ALWAYS check for existing work items** before creating new ones (QC-13)
4. **ALWAYS track work** using the PM tool from beginning to end (QC-13)
5. **ALWAYS add evidence of completion** as comments when work is done (QC-13)
6. **ALWAYS follow the decision tree** (INT-DECISION-01) for rule application
7. **ALWAYS monitor rule effectiveness** (INT-METRICS-01) and performance
8. **ALWAYS resolve conflicts** using the conflict resolution hierarchy (INT-CONFLICT-01)
9. **ALWAYS maintain rule quality** and prevent staleness (GLOBAL-01)
10. **ALWAYS apply appropriate globs** for intelligent rule application

**RULE APPLICATION PRIORITY:**
1. Security Rules (SEC-01, INT-SEC-01) - HIGHEST PRIORITY
2. Core Rules (GLOBAL-01, QC-*, GIT-01) - ALWAYS APPLY
3. Integration Rules (INT-CONFLICT-01, INT-DECISION-01, INT-METRICS-01) - ALWAYS APPLY
4. Architecture Rules (API-01, DP-01, FE-01) - APPLY INTELLIGENTLY
5. Platform Rules (MB-*, K8S-01, INF-01) - APPLY BASED ON CONTEXT
6. Operational Rules (OPEX-01, MONITOR-01) - MANUAL/TRIGGERED
7. Specialized Integration Rules (INT-TEST-01, INT-PERF-01) - APPLY BASED ON CONTEXT

**MANDATORY PROTOCOL:**
- Read ALL rules completely before starting work
- Apply rules based on file type and context
- Use the decision tree for rule application decisions
- Monitor rule effectiveness and performance
- Maintain rule quality and prevent staleness
- Resolve conflicts using the established hierarchy
- Track all work using the PM tool
- Add evidence of completion as comments

**FAILURE TO FOLLOW THESE RULES WILL RESULT IN:**
- Incomplete work that doesn't meet standards
- Security vulnerabilities and compliance issues
- Poor code quality and maintainability
- Inefficient development processes
- Rule conflicts and inconsistencies
- Stale and ineffective rules

**SUCCESS METRICS:**
- 100% rule compliance
- 95%+ rule effectiveness
- 0% stale rules
- 100% security compliance
- Complete work tracking and documentation
- Continuous rule improvement and optimization

This is a comprehensive, integrated rule system that ensures high-quality, secure, and maintainable development practices. Follow ALL rules systematically and completely.
