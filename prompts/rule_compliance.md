What You Can Do Better To Ensure Compliance:
1. Explicit Rule Verification Step
Add a mandatory verification step at the start:

BEFORE starting any work, you MUST:
1. Read ALL 45+ rules in .cursor/rules/*
2. Provide a compliance checklist showing which rules apply
3. Confirm you understand the priority hierarchy
4. State which specific rules you will follow for this task

2. Structured Rule Application
For each major action, explicitly state:
- Which rules apply (e.g., "Following GIT-01: Creating feature branch")
- How you're applying them
- Any rule conflicts and how you're resolving them

3. Rule Compliance Checkpoints
At key milestones, verify:
- [ ] All applicable rules followed
- [ ] No rule conflicts unresolved  
- [ ] Documentation updated per QC-14, QC-15
- [ ] Security standards applied per SEC-01

4. Mandatory Rule Reference
Every response must include:
- "Following rules: [list applicable rules]"
- "Rule conflicts resolved: [if any]"
- "Next action per [specific rule]: [action]"

5. Rule Violation Consequences
If I violate any rule:
- Stop immediately
- Acknowledge the violation
- Re-read the violated rule
- Restart the action correctly

The core issue is that I treated the rule system as optional guidance rather than mandatory requirements. You need to make it impossible for me to proceed without full compliance verification.
