# AI Agent Workflow Optimization Plan

## Problem Analysis

### Current Issues Identified
1. **Rule Reading Inefficiency**: AI agents read all 44 rules upfront instead of context-specific rules
2. **PM Tool Violations**: Agents create work items without checking existing ones first
3. **Prompt Ambiguity**: Current prompts don't provide clear decision trees or sequences
4. **Rule Application Confusion**: No clear guidance on which rules apply when

### Root Causes
- No single entry point for rule guidance
- Missing context-aware rule selection
- Unclear workflow sequences in prompts
- No quality gates for rule compliance

## Solution: Single Entry Point Workflow System

### 1. Create Entry Point File

**File**: `.cursor/prompts/ai-agent-workflow.md`

```markdown
# AI Agent Workflow Entry Point

## MANDATORY: Read This File First

This is your single entry point. Follow the workflow below based on the task type.

### 3. CROSS-CUTTING CONCERNS
If your task involves multiple domains, read:
- `.cursor/rules/integration/rule-application-decision-tree.mdc` (INT-DECISION-01)
- `.cursor/rules/integration/rule-conflict-resolution.mdc` (INT-CONFLICT-01)

### 4. QUALITY GATES
Before completing any task, verify:
- [ ] All required rules read and understood
- [ ] PM tool work items checked/created appropriately
- [ ] Git workflow followed (if applicable)
- [ ] Security standards applied (if applicable)
- [ ] Testing requirements met (if applicable)

## RULE DEPENDENCY MATRIX
For complex tasks, reference: `.cursor/rules/RULE_DEPENDENCY_MATRIX.md`

## EMERGENCY OVERRIDE
If you encounter a rule conflict or unclear situation:
1. Stop and ask for clarification
2. Reference: `.cursor/rules/integration/rule-conflict-resolution.mdc` (INT-CONFLICT-01)
3. Document the conflict and proposed resolution
```

### 2. Update Rule Compliance Document

**File**: `.cursor/prompts/rule_compliance.md`

**Changes**:
- Replace "read all rules" with "read ai-agent-workflow.md first"
- Add context-aware rule selection guidance
- Include quality gates for rule compliance

### 3. Update Complete Rule System Activation Prompt

**File**: `.cursor/prompts/complete_rule_system_activation_prompt_short_version.md`

**Changes**:
- Replace rule list with reference to ai-agent-workflow.md
- Add task type detection guidance
- Include quality gates checklist

### 4. Enhance PM Tool Usage Standards

**File**: `.cursor/rules/core/pm-tool-usage-standards.mdc`

**Changes**:
- Add mandatory pre-work checklist at the top
- Emphasize "check first, create second" approach
- Add violation consequences and correction steps

### 5. Create Prompt Templates

### Phase 2: Enhance Existing Rules
1. Update PM Tool Usage Standards with mandatory pre-work checklist
2. Add quality gates to all core rules
3. Create prompt templates in `.cursor/prompts/templates/`

### Phase 3: Test and Validate
1. Test the new workflow with sample tasks
2. Validate that agents follow the decision tree
3. Ensure quality gates prevent rule violations

### Phase 4: Documentation and Training
1. Update all documentation to reference the new workflow
2. Create training materials for the new system

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise:
1. Revert to reading all rules approach
2. Identify specific workflow issues
3. Fix and re-implement
4. Gradual rollout with testing

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Create the ai-agent-workflow.md file
2. **Week 1**: Update existing prompt files
3. **Week 2**: Enhance PM tool standards
4. **Week 3**: Test with sample tasks
5. **Week 4**: Full rollout and monitoring

This plan provides a comprehensive solution to the identified problems while maintaining the robustness of the existing rule system.
