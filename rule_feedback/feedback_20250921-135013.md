# Rule Feedback Report

**Date**: 2025-09-21 13:50:13
**Feedback Type**: Prompt Improvement Suggestions
**Status**: Active

## Issues Encountered

### 1. Template Usage Clarity
**Rule Reference**: AI Agent Workflow Entry Point
**Issue**: Prompt says 'Read and follow' but doesn't specify HOW to read the templates
**Impact**: AI agents may not know to execute commands within templates
**Suggestion**: Make template usage explicit

### 2. Quality Gates Specificity
**Rule Reference**: Quality Gates Section
**Issue**: 'Context analysis completed (if troubleshooting)' is vague
**Impact**: AI agents may not know what constitutes complete context analysis
**Suggestion**: Be more specific

### 3. Evidence Requirements Clarity
**Rule Reference**: Evidence Requirements Section
**Issue**: 'Screenshots or logs showing successful completion' - AI agents can't take screenshots
**Impact**: Unrealistic evidence requirements
**Suggestion**: Remove screenshots, focus on actionable evidence

### 4. Fallback Section Enhancement
**Rule Reference**: Fallback Section
**Issue**: Fallback is good but could be more actionable
**Impact**: AI agents may not know specific commands to execute
**Suggestion**: Add specific commands

### 5. Feedback File Path Issue
**Rule Reference**: Feedback Requirements Section
**Issue**: `rule_feedback/feedback_YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.md` - this directory might not exist
**Impact**: AI agents may fail to create feedback files
**Suggestion**: Use existing structure

## Overall Assessment
**Strengths**: Clear workflow structure, specific template references, quality gates defined
**The prompt will work** with these minor improvements.

## Recommendations
1. **High Priority**: Fix template usage clarity and evidence requirements
2. **Medium Priority**: Enhance quality gates specificity and fallback commands
3. **Low Priority**: Fix feedback file path
